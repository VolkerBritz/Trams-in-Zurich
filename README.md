# Trams-in-Zurich

The city of Zürich provides extensive data on scheduled and actual times at which trams arrive and depart from stops.
One such dataset is made available per week on their open data website:

https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrzeiten_ogd

Using Python, I provide a module of functions that allow for fast analysis and visualization of holdups at stops as well as on trajectories, and for comparitive evaluation of the various tram lines.
