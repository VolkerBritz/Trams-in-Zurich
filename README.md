# Trams-in-Zurich

The city of ZÃ¼rich provides extensive data on scheduled and actual times at which trams arrive and depart from stops.
One such dataset is made available per week on their open data website:

https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrzeiten_ogd

Using Python, I provide functions that allow for fast analysis and visualization of holdups at stops and on trajectories,
and for comparitive evaluation of the various tram lines.
